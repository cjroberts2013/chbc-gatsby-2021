            College Heights Baptist Church began in the hearts of a handful of people who felt the ministry of another Baptist Church in Wharton was needed. The Wharton Baptist Fellowship was formed and discovered a place to meet in Dr. Blasingame’s home on North Richmond Road. The first services were held there on July 3rd, 1966. Two weeks later, in a special meeting with sister churches of the Colorado Baptist Association, College Heights Baptist Church was constituted as a church and accepted into the Colorado Baptist Association.

            Reverend Glenn Booth began to serve as the Interim Pastor, driving to Wharton from Houston each Sunday. He served well until the church reached a state where it desired a full-time pastor. It was not Reverend Booth’s desire to serve the Church as pastor and he very graciously led and aided the church in seeking a shepherd.

            On March 19, 1967, Reverend B.J. Armstrong moved on the church field as the first full-time pastor of the young church. Brother Armstrong, a native of Abilene, moved to Wharton from the pastorate of the Richards Baptist Church in Richards, Texas.

            In the summer of 1967, the first Vacation Bible School was held. It was well attended and everyone marveled at the ways the Blasingame home adapted itself for use as a church. The Church began to have all the functions of a church. There were Bible Studies, Study Courses, Brotherhood and Women’s Missionary Union meetings and social gatherings in addition to Sunday School, Training Union and regular worship services.

            There was always the desire for a permanent building on the church property at 1515 Briar Lane. A planning and survey committee was formed to determine how the property could best be utilized. Plans were adopted and a Building Committee was formed and a Building Finance Committee was also elected. Soon, plans were presented and adopted favoring the building of a single unit structure incorporating a sanctuary and a fully departmentalized Sunday School and Training Union. The Building Finance Committee reported the financing was available and the plan was adopted as presented.

            On May 19, 1968 ground was broken for the new building and construction began the next day. From that time until the last Sunday in September, there was a steady stream of workmen, materials and church members at the building site. Construction was completed and Dedication of the Building was held on January 19th, 1969.

            By 1985, the Church was debt-free even with the addition of a paved parking area. As the Lord continued to bless, a new education and family-life facility was added in the summer of 1988.
